Our code is not the most marvelous or impressive, but I believe in sharing what I have learned in the development process. Source files for art assets, game mechanics, dialogs, and even music files are all available. This is a humble attempt to give back to the creative community, from which I've learned so much. There's no secrets at Bramble Gate Studios.
