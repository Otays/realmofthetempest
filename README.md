# About #
Realm of the Tempest (ROTT) is a fantasy adventure role-playing game created by Bramble Gate Studios. The gameplay focuses on turn-based combat and minigames, while offering a large system of interconnected worlds the player can explore by hopping through portals. The story is still a work in progress, but when it's done it'll be a fun one.

Our code is not the most marvelous or impressive, but I believe in sharing what I have learned in the development process. Source files for art assets, game mechanics, dialogs, and even music files are all available. I really hope this contributes to the creative community.
